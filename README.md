# Vending Machine Project

A simple, text-based vending machine simulator written in Python.

⚠️ **This project is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet functional.** ⚠️

## Description

This project aims to create a basic simulation of a vending machine. The current structure includes classes for the main machine (`VendingMachine`) and for items (starting with `chips`). The main execution logic is set up to greet the user and ask for an item choice, but it is not fully implemented.

## Project Structure

* **`main.py`**: Contains the main Python script with class definitions (`VendingMachine`, `chips`) and the incomplete run-time logic.
* **`LICENSE`**: The license file for this project.
* **`tempCodeRunnerFile.py`**: A temporary file, likely auto-generated by an IDE, and not part of the core project.

## Current Features (and Planned Work)

* **Classes:**
    * `VendingMachine`: A class intended to hold the machine's state, such as total amount and item stocks.
    * `chips`: A class representing the chips item category.
    * `drinks`: (Placeholder) Intended for drink items.
    * `candy`: (Placeholder) Intended for candy items.
* **Main Logic:**
    * A welcome message is printed.
    * It asks for payment type ("Coin or Cash").
    * It attempts to ask for an item choice (Chips, Drinks, Candy).

## To-Do / Future Work

This project requires significant development to become functional. Key areas include:

1.  **Complete Item Classes:** Fully implement the `drinks` and `candy` classes.
2.  **Fix `chips` Class:** The `get_price` method appears to concatenate price and stock instead of returning just the price. The `NameOfChips` method is empty.
3.  **Implement Main Logic:** The main execution block needs to be fixed.
    * Correctly handle user input for `choice` (e.g., convert to `int`).
    * Properly instantiate the chosen item class (e.g., `chips(...)` needs arguments).
    * Implement the payment logic based on the `payment_type` variable.
    * Connect the item classes and the `VendingMachine` class to manage stock and transactions.
4.  **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is incorrectly implemented (it *raises* a `ValueError` instead of *catching* one). This needs to be rewritten.
5.  **Create `.gitignore`:** A `.gitignore` file should be added to exclude files like `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`.
